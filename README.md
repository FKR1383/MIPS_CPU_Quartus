# MIPS_CPU_Quartus
We simulate Single cycle, multicycle and pipelined MIPS CPU with block diagram mode in Quartus program.

In these simulations, we first make ALU and memory blocks. Then, we make Single cycle, multi cycle and pipelines version of MIPS CPU. at last we make a branch predictor for pipeline version.

All of these simulation have tests. for more details, just see Doc file in each folder.

This is our practices in Computer architecture course at Sharif University of Technology (SUT).

## Tools
- Quartus II (13.1)


## Implementation Details

We first make ALU and memory blocks. Then, we make Single cycle, multi cycle and pipelines version of MIPS CPU. at last we make a branch predictor for pipeline version.
The CPUs support these instructions (ISA):

## How to Run

Just open the files in Quartus and take instructions to CPU and data files to Memory, using .mif files.
Then, with waveform, you can see results. (some examples are in Doc files.)
